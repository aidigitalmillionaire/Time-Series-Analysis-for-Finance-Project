# ⏱️ Time Series Analysis for Finance

This project applies **Time Series Analysis** to financial datasets to forecast stock and market behavior.  
Built in **Google Colab**, the notebook demonstrates classic models like **ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters** as well as **LSTM-based deep learning** for sequential prediction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on financial time series.
- Apply statistical models (**ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing**).
- Build deep learning models (**LSTM, GRU**) for financial forecasting.
- Compare model performance with evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE).
- Visualize predictions vs actual stock/market data.

This project demonstrates **Time Series Forecasting** techniques for financial markets using real-world stock datasets. It includes both **traditional statistical models** (ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters) and **deep learning models** (LSTM, GRU) for capturing sequential patterns in financial time series.

The notebook explores:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Stationarity checks and transformations
- Forecasting with ARIMA/SARIMA
- Neural networks for sequence modeling
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE
- Comparative insights for business decision-making

Dataset: [Kaggle – Dollar Exchange Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cavinlobo/dollar-exchange)

Goal: Provide a framework for **financial time series forecasting** that is reproducible and adaptable for other markets.
